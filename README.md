# Verilog Projects

This repository contains various Verilog projects that can be used for digital circuit design and simulation. Verilog is a hardware description language (HDL) used for modeling digital systems at various levels of abstraction.

## Projects

This repository contains the following Verilog projects:

- **Project 1- ADDER**: The objective of this project is to design and implement Verilog code for differnt types of adders such as HalfAdder, FullAdder, and FourBitAdder.

- **Project 2 - BCD**: The objective of this project is to design and implement a modified Verilog module that can increment with improved accuracy through one-second intervals.

## Getting Started

To use these Verilog projects, you will need a Verilog compiler and simulator. You can use any Verilog compiler and simulator of your choice. 

To compile and simulate a Verilog project, you can use the following commands:

- `$ verilog -o <output_file> <verilog_file>`
- `$ vvp <output_file>`

Replace `<output_file>` with the name of the output file and `<verilog_file>` with the name of the Verilog file you want to compile.
